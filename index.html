        <h2 class="subheading">Origin</h2>
        <p>
            Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. His mother is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maye_Musk" target="_blank">Maye Musk</a>.
            His father is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Musk" target="_blank">Errol Musk</a>.
            Musk has a younger brother, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimbal_Musk" target="_blank">Kimbal</a>, and a younger sister, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosca_Musk" target="_blank">Tosca</a>.<br>
            His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca airplane to Africa and Australia.<br>
            Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. Musk's family was wealthy during his youth. His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, with the Musk children reportedly sharing their father's dislike of apartheid.<br>
            After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father, a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted. Musk has become estranged from his father.<br>

        <h2 class="subheading">Education</h2>
        <p>
            Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada, Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.<br>
            While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African military.<br>
            Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.<br>
            In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School in 1995.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games.<br>
            In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California.<br>
            Musk tried to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries.<br>
            He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch a startup.<br>

    <ul>
        <li class="company">
            <h3>Zip2</h3>
            <p>
                In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds borrowed from Musk's father.<br>
                They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.<br>
                The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages.<br>
                Musk says that before the company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and instead rented an office; he slept on the couch, showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother.<br>
            </p>

        <li class="company">
            <h3>X.com and PayPal</h3>
            <p>
                In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.<br>
                The startup was one of the first federally insured online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers joined the service.<br>
                The company's investors regarded Musk as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.<br>
                The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition.<br>
                Founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Levchin">Max Levchin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel">Peter Thiel</a>, Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Within the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference for Microsoft software over Unix created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.<br>
                Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.<br>
                Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.<br>
                In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million.<br>
                In 2017 Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, explaining it has sentimental value.<br>
            </p>

        <li class="company">
            <h3>SpaceX</h3>
            <p>
                In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.<br>
                In October the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space.<br>
                He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and the group returned to the United States empty-handed.<br>
                In February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs.<br>
                They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected.<br>
                He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[68] With $100 million of his early fortune, Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and become the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on an in-land platform.<br>
                Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.<br>
                In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.<br>
                Since 2019, SpaceX is developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and Heavy.<br>
                In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.<br>

        <li class="company">
            <h3>Tesla</h3>
            <p>
                Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.<br>
                Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.<br>
                Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.<br>
                Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.<br>
                Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.<br>
                A cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.<br>
                A mass market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.<br>
                The Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.<br>
                A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020.<br>
                The Cybertruck—an all-electric pickup truck—was unveiled in 2019.<br>
                Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, such as Gigafactory 1 in Nevada, Gigafactory 2 in New York, Gigafactory 3 in China, Gigafactory 4 in Germany and Gigafactory 5 in Texas.<br>

            <h3>Neuralink</h3>
            <p>
                In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain to facilitate its merging with machines.<br>
                The devices will also reconcile with the latest improvements in AI to stay updated.<br>
                Such improvements could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software more effectively.<br>
